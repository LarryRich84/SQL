i started by downloading this Spotify data table from Kaggle

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

next i took a look to see what the table included
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

Next i wanted to see what artist and song everyone was enjoying.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(liveness), AVG(popularity) 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name 
LIMIT 10;

Next i wanted to see what songs were most people dancing to.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability DESC
LIMIT 10;

SELECT track_name, track_id, AVG(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity;
